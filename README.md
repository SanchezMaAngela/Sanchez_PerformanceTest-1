Objective: The performance test aims to evaluate your ability to retrieve, sort, and select backend courses data according to specified requirements.

Test Procedure:
1.	Download and install the MongoDB Database tool
2.	Import the file “courses.json” to MongoDb
3.	Create API endpoint to retrieve, sort, and select the backend courses

Endpoint to retrieve backend courses alphabetically. 
http://localhost:4000/api/backend-courses/

Endpoint to select and extract the name and specialization of each course
http://localhost:4000/api/course-details

Endpoint to retrieve all BSIS and BSIT courses
http://localhost:4000/api/courses

To retrieve all BSIS courses
http://localhost:4000/api/courses/bsis

To retrieve BSIT
http://localhost:4000/api/courses/bsit

I find it difficult to understand the concepts of MongoDB. The challenge I encountered is connecting to MongoDB. In order to solve this, I searched for online resources to understand it further and tried to connect it successfully.
